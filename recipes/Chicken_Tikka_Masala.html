    <h1>Chicken Tikka Masala</h1>
    <P>Dive into the vibrant and aromatic world of Chicken Tikka Masala, <br>
        a beloved dish that marries tender pieces of marinated chicken with <br>
        a rich, spiced tomato and cream sauce. The chicken is first marinated <br>
        in a blend of yogurt and spices, then grilled to perfection. <br>
        It's then simmered in a sauce made from onions, tomatoes, garlic, <br>
        ginger, and a variety of spices including cumin, coriander, and garam masala. <br>
        The addition of heavy cream gives the sauce a luscious, velvety texture. <br>
        Garnished with fresh cilantro, this dish pairs beautifully with basmati <br>
        rice or warm naan bread, making it a perfect choice for a flavorful and satisfying meal.
