        <p>
            Embrace the versatility and elegance of Classic French Crepes, a staple of French cuisine. <br>
            These thin, delicate pancakes are made from a simple batter of flour, eggs, milk, water, <br>
            and melted butter, resulting in a light and airy texture. Crepes can be served with a variety <br>
            of fillings, from sweet options like Nutella, fresh fruits, and whipped cream to savory combinations<br>

            skillet and a thin, even layer of batter. Whether enjoyed for breakfast, brunch, or dessert, <br>
            these crepes offer endless possibilities for delightful and sophisticated dining.

    <h2>Ingredients Needed</h2>
        <p>This is a list of all the required Ingredients for this simple dish.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter, melted</li>
            <li>Additional butter for cooking</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Follow these steps below to make this wonderful dish.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong> Make the Batter:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, 
                whisk together the flour and eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, 
                stirring to combine. Add the salt and melted butter, whisking until smooth.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Rest the Batter:</strong> Let the batter sit at room temperature 
                for about 30 minutes. This helps to ensure the crepes will be light and tender.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Cook the Crepes:</strong>Heat a lightly oiled non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
                 Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Cook Each Side:</strong>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, 
                flip and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve crepes warm with your choice of fillings. Classic options include lemon and sugar, 
                Nutella, fresh fruits, or savory fillings like ham and cheese.
            </li>

        </ol>
